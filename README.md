==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.


The run_analysis.R script does the following:
=============================================

## 1. Reads the following downloaded files and creates dataframes
   * activity_labels.txt
   * features.txt
   * Y_test.txt
   * Y_train.txt
   * subject_test.txt
   * subject_train.txt
   * X_test.txt
   * X_train.txt

## 2. Combines data
   * Combines test and train data using rbind()
   * Adds names to columns
   * Updates Activity column with descriptions

## 3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
   * The SubsetFeatures vector is created with the measurement columns and then subset() creates a SubsetFeaturesData dataframe with the columns needed
   * cbind() is then used to combine this data with the subjects and activities

## 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
   * Characters are removed from column names using gsub

## 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set (CombinedTidy) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
   * This is done using the dyplr commands group_by() and summarize_each()
   * This dataset is written to a text file called tidydata.txt

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
