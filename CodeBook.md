# Identifiers

 Subject - identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
 Activity - identifies the activity labels 

 Note: Activity labels are defined as follows:
 	WALKING: subject was walking during the test
	WALKING_UPSTAIRS: subject was walking up a staircase during the test
	WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS: subject was walking down a staircase during the test
	SITTING: subject was sitting during the test
	STANDING: subject was standing during the test
	LAYING: subject was laying down during the test

Notes:

- TotalAcc variables: The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'.  

- BodyAcc variables- The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- BodyGyro variables: The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.
